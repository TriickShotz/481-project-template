## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

My name is Cindy and I’m a mother of 3. My 2 daughters Flow and Mindy ages 5 and 10 are looking to find information on dance classes. I’m looking to find the best possible situation so I don’t have to make multiple trips to the recreation center as juggling this many children and this many activities is rather difficult. I hope to be able to easily find classes with similar times for the proper age group. My son is aged 7 and is not interested in any classes but loves to swim. An ideal situation would allow me to find a multi use pass to take him swimming while the girls are in dance classes.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

![](Images/sketching.jpg "Overall Sketching Process")

We have each created a variety of sketches of ideas for our recreation center application. These ideas range anywhere from games that determine an event you can do that day to a more in depth view of our user interface. We have learned a lot about the possibilities that exist, as well as some more creative options.

* This first image we have a more basic overview of our application and how the navigation should work. Illustrates some of the key options in a small storyboard format that will allow us to generate an idea of the options needed to include in our application prototype.  

* This second image also has somewhat of an overview, but instead of the navigation, it is more aimed towards how we want to layout or information page to page in a way that is visually appealing to our users, but also efficient and useful for navigating to the desired information.

## Reflection

When we first were trying to figure out our designs we were all over the place. Essentially what it boiled down to when we were looking at the brainstorm phase was that each of us had a different idea for what features our app should contain. So we mixed a hybrid of multiple ideas, pretty much taking the best part of each one of those ideas and discarding the rest. We then made the storyboard and prototype video based on our design and presented it in front of the class. When we presented our prototype we got a lot of questions asked and comments how others could improve our idea. It was then that we realised that our prototype was a mess with multiple features that didn’t really mix well together. So we scraped pretty much the whole thing and worked off of the based suggestions we got in tut. A few of the suggestions that we followed were to make a search bar, clear up the clutter when searching for rec centers, rearrange our buttons to better display what each of them meant, got rid of our search list (which was a bar at the bottom that popped up where you could see a list of all our information), rearranged how we organized and showed our information(since we got rid of the search list we needed to organize our information differently). Looking back at the whole process we did to get to our final design we probably should have looked at examples others had done before us and asked people who were not from our group to evaluate our ideas since we were slightly biased into thinking all our ideas were good.
