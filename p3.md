## Heuristic Evaluation Results
1 - High Priority, 5 - Low Priority

### User Control and Freedome - Priority 1
#### Problem:
Users need to navigate to multiple recreation center menus in order to get their news.
#### Solution:
Create a more general button in the main menu that will display news for all subscribed recreation centers.

### Consistency and Standards - Priority 2
#### Problem:
Back button doesn't take you to the previous page, it instead takes you "up" a level (predetermined page).
#### Solution:
Use some sort of method to track history of the user to properly go to previous pages.

### Help and Documentation - Priority: 3
#### Problem: 
Yoga-Core calendar has no legend, what do the green squares mean?
#### Solution: 
Add a legend or some other indicator to let the user know that the green squares mean that there is an available class that day.

### Consistency and Standards - Priority 4
#### Problem:
Favourites button does not perform a function when viewing the map page.
#### Solution:
Remove the favourites button from the map page, as it serves no relevant purpose in this scenario.

### Consistency and Standards - Priority 5
#### Problem:
Some links dont work in the application, while others do. eg Facebook link works, the Southland Leisure home page link does not.
#### Solution:
Ensure that all links work correctly.
