# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

Our goal was to build an app that with all the Recreation Centers in Calgary. The app works by partnerships with the City of Calgary to provide information to the public and Recreation Centers to get information about programs, live updates, news,  etc. 

In achieving our goal we based our app on people who are looking to attend recreational centers or are currently attending recreational centers. So the aim was to provide information to new or curious users looking at recreation centers, but also provide customization and live updates to our long time current users.


## Introduction

Our project is an City of Calgary Recreation Center App. In this app we cover all the recreational centers in Calgary, and display general information about them and allow our users to customize their needs.

The app aims to target users that actively attend recreation centers and potential users who are thinking about attending recreational centers. Keep in mind recreation centers are family friendly institutions, meaning that our audience is a wide range of people of all ages. But for the purpose of simplification we can break them down into 3 categories; children, adults, and elderly.


### Children:

So first up is children. How we define children are users that can use our app but hold no real “purchasing power”. We say purchasing power because these are users that can navigate to a program or class they desire, but lack the means of transportation to the class, money to be able to register for the class, and overall permission from an adult. So in order to register for a class their parent or guardian would be the one to pay and register them.

Their interests range from fun activities the recreation centers offer such as day camps to more thrilling activities such as contact sports.

### Adults:

The adults are the majority of our users. They are independant users that either go to our recreation centers for a single purpose or tag along with other people, but most of the time is for the latter. This is the audience that we are going to mainly focus when we develop our app. The reason why these users come to our recreation centers is to get something out of it; some examples are to work on their physical appearance, meet up with friends and have fun in our facilities. 

Their interests range from workout facilities to classes that target the body to facilities that allow groups to have fun.


### Elderly:

These users are the ones with the most time on their hands. They enjoy being in the presence of others like themselves and are the most sociable type of group. Generally speaking they do not come to the recreational center to “work-out”, but rather socialize with others. These users look for classes that are not too involved with moving and enjoy taking their time such as yoga meditation classes.

Their interests are mild classes that are not too fast paced.


More in depth about our users:

Up above we categorized our users into 3 categories; children, adults,and elderly. We can further expand these categories by going into specializations “the regular” and “the newbie”.


### The regular:
 
The regular is the very active user of the recreation center. He/she knows the ins and outs of everything at their recreation center. They know exactly what they want and how to find and achieve it. So just having general information in our app isn’t enough for them to just download the app and continuously use it. The best way to get these users to use our app is to provide news, updates, and best times to be there.

### The newbie:

These users are people who are not regulars and are thinking about going to a recreational center. However they need further information and guides to incentivize them to go. This would be though general information about programs, classes and facilities.


### Stakeholders:

Other than the users, the stakeholders also have an interest in how our app is doing. Unlike the users of our system or the developers behind the app the stakeholders see this not like an app but a promotion tool to help advertise their recreation centers. The more people they have coming to the recreation center the more income they will be able to accumulate. So this app is a big deal to our stakeholders, they want users to continually come back to use our app to be able to promote special events.


## Design Problem

The first step was to come up with our target audience. We decided that it was anybody within the city of calgary that was a recreation center user or a potential user. With these considerations in mind our design problem focused on how to share information to these users based on what they wanted to know(hours, prices, number of current users, etc). There was a ton of information we needed to find a way to share in an organized way so that our user could find what they wanted easily. This was by far our biggest challenge as we had to appeal to a wide range of users. These users all having different goals, familiarities with the facilities and experience with touch interface phones. We then spent some time developing features that could make the experience more pleasurable. Our prime example of this is the alert center where you can turn on and off push notifications for specific recreation centers news updates. 

## User Research and Findings

The user research that we chose to conduct were Interviews, Surveys and Secondary Research. Each of these 3 methods conducted were aimed at different audiences to collect a range of information that could help make our application as diverse as possible. The interviews that were conducted were not aimed at a particular audience, other than ensuring that we interviewed people outside of a recreation center in order to get their view on why they may not use the recreation centers themselves. The goal of our survey was to get a large number of immediate responses from as many people as possible, in hopes of getting the views of the majority. Finally our secondary research was aimed at user reviews, these reviews came from google and were left for recreation centers in Calgary, such as U of C facility, Southland Leisure Center, and Repsol Center. The information that we received helped guide us towards a goal of providing what the people wanted. Which happens to be live updates, and information about classes and drop in times. We ensured that these features would be included in our application.

## Design and Justification

Our application is aimed at being information based for a collection of recreation centers under one name. Our application focused on the City of Calgary Recreation and featured recreation centers such as Southland Leisure Center, and Glenmore Sailing School. The design goals that we had in mind was to make something intuitive, simple to use, and appealing to the user, unlike the current websites in place. What we decided to do was to implement a simple menu system which gives our users choices, customizability, and the ability to convey information to the user in a simple way. So for each recreation center we would divide up the important information into more general categories that would contain the specific information that the user may be searching for. By keeping our application as information focused as possible we were able to avoid including unnecessary features that belong is a separate application.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

We found a large number of things within this section. A Lot of these things were consistency and standards things like buttons not working or not spaced properly. Most of these were very little and easy to fix but until we dove into the program with a fine tooth comb did not notice. The surprising thing about this was that as little as they were to us they could have a been a nightmare for anyone of our users had they slipped through the cracks. We found a couple problems we deemed to be major problems. The first being a user control and freedom bug that forced you to go to every recreation page to get all their news updates. The second being a recognition vs recall bug that would force you to recall your class number to register for the classes alerts in the alert center. We did formulate ideas on how to fix these things and they would be the first things fixed in a future iteration of our system. 

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

Our design isn't  perfect, and we know that. So there are a few things that we would like to consider when creating the next iteration of our design. Our current application places our news feed in each individual recreation center. We would like to move the news feeds location to the main menu where users will be able to get all of their news in one location. Our current class looking and registration feature relies on a user to remember a class number that must then be entered on a separate page, we would like to implement the ability for the user to subscribe and register for that class on the same page that you are able to view the class number to avoid any possible errors. Finally we would like to attend to any bugs and issues that have been discussed in our heuristic evaluation.
